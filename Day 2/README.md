# 📊 Day 2 – Google Sheets Era Begins 😎

Yuhh, welcome to Day 2 of me tryna become *the data guy* 💻  
Today we dived into the world of Google Sheets (cuz my system said no to Excel 💀)  
And guess what? I’m vibing with it 😤📈

## 🧠 What I Learned
- `VLOOKUP()` – Find things like a detective 🕵️‍♂️
- `COUNTIF()` – Count like your life depends on it 🎯
- `SUMIF()` – Add but only if you’re loyal 💸
- Basic formulas but with ✨ smartness ✨

## 🤓 What's next?
Tbh… mastering these functions, getting slick with sheets, and then breaking into deeper stuff like Power BI and SQL.  
Still got that fire in me. Ain’t stopping till I make money with my brain 🧠💰

Stay tuned or stay confused 😌  
Peace out – Keval 🚀🐻
