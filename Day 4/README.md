# 📆 Day 4 — Confused? Tired? Still did it. Yuh 😤

Today was… *a whole mission* 😵‍💫  
Google Sheets threw tantrums, formulas screamed, and my brain ran on 3% battery — but guess what?

I still showed up. I GOTTALEARN no matter what. 💪

## 💡 What I did today:
- Played with `SUBSTITUTE`, `FIND`, and `MID` like a mini hacker 🧠
- Figured out how to keep that `+91` alive 🔢📞
- Found out formulas love commas more than I thought ,,, (lol)
- Fought formula errors like a warrior 💥⚔️
- Wrote things, deleted things, cried, laughed — the usual spreadsheet chaos 🧾😂

## 🎯 Mood:
Confused? Tired? YES.  
Learning something new and vibing anyway? ALSO YES 😎

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Google Sheets (my frenemy today lol)
- Coffee (emotional support ☕)
- Grit + vibes + chaos + a bit of “what even is this function”
