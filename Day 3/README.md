# 📅 Day 3 – Google Sheets: not just cells, it’s a situationsheet now 😤

Okay so today? Text functions got real.  
I was basically slicing up words like some formula ninja 🥷📄  
Not gonna lie... started enjoying this stuff 👀

---

## 🧠 Stuff I unlocked today:

- `FIND()` – yo where that letter hiding??  
- `MID()` – cut the word, get the good part 🍕  
- `LEN()` – how long is this word? Let me count the vibes  
- `IFERROR()` – nah bro we don’t panic on errors 🙅

---

## 🧪 What I did:

- Took book data 📚  
- Extracted second words like it’s a magic show 🎩  
- Spotted letter positions like a human debugger 🧠  
- Fixed formula errors like a casual boss

## 🗂️ Files?

All the chaos I call progress is in `/day3/`  
Check it if you dare 😤

## 🧃 That lil feeling of “yo I actually did something today”

No big moves. Just small wins stacking.  
Cell by cell. Day by day.  
And yeah… it feels kinda good 😌
